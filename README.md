Here are the primary codes employed in the research paper titled "Blood plasma proteome-wide association study implicates novel proteins in the pathogenesis of multiple cardiovascular diseases". The data utilized for these analyses originates from the UK Biobank cohort and publicly available GWAS data. We have also made publicly available a plasma protein genetic prediction model established based on the UKB-PPP protein data, which allows researchers to further explore and conduct additional investigations building upon this foundation.
